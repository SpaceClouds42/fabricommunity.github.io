# Uploading Log Files
To get help, you should provide a log file. This file provides essential information to find out why Minecraft has crashed.  
Please follow the relevant tutorial for the launcher you're using. If you are unsure about this, follow the standard launcher tutorial.

## Getting the log file
---
### Standard Launcher
1. **Open the minecraft launcher and go to the "Installations" tab.**  
   [![Installations tab](/static/images/using/logs/vanilla-launcher-open-installations-tab.png)](/static/images/using/logs/vanilla-launcher-open-installations-tab.png)
2. **Open the relevant installation's folder.**

3.
   * **The last time I launched Minecraft it crashed:** Open the `logs` folder and upload the `latest.log` file. [See "uploading the log"](#uploading-your-log-file)
   * **I have opened Minecraft since:** Open the `crash-reports` folder and upload the relevant file. This directory only contains crashes. [See "uploading the log"](#uploading-your-log-file)

### MultiMC
1. **Press the `upload` button on the upper right of the screen that pops up once you launch the game.**  
   *If you have closed this window, press `edit instance` > `minecraft log` (if this doesn't appear, press `other logs` and select `latest.log`). Here you should find the upload button*
2. **You can now simply paste the link MultiMc gives you. It should be on your clipboard already.**
