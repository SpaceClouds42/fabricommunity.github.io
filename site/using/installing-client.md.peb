# Installing Fabric

To play Minecraft with Fabric mods, you'll first need to install Fabric.

## Standard Launcher
***
1. Download the Fabric installer from [below](#download-fabric-installer-v).
1. Open the installer.
   <br>
    You can change the directory for the profile by changing the install location, it should default to your `.minecraft/` folder.

1. Select the desired MC version.
   <br>
    It defaults to the latest stable release; to choose a snapshot version, click show snapshots.

1. Click `install`.
   <br>
    A pop-up will appear once it has completed installing.

You have now installed the Fabric mod loader! If you open up the Minecraft launcher, there will be a newly created version called `fabric-loader-<mcversion>`. You can now run this installation to play with Fabric mods.

Most mods require the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), so it's best to add that to your `.minecraft/mods/` folder.

Another very useful mod to have is [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu). It allows you to access many mods' config menus, and it gives you a complete list of all currently loaded mods.
